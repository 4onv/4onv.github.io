        <h2>History, Context, and Reconciliation</h2>
        <p>
            Residential schools were a tragic chapter in Canada’s history, where Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families 
            and placed in institutions designed to assimilate them. The trauma from these experiences persists, impacting generations of 
            Indigenous communities. It’s crucial to understand this history, honor the victims, and commit to reconciliation to build a better future.
