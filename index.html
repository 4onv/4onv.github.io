            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>The history of residential schools in Canada is a deeply painful chapter marked by the forced removal of Indigenous children from their families, cultural assimilation, and systemic abuse. Thousands of children never returned home, with unmarked burial sites still being discovered. This tragic legacy highlights the ongoing challenges of reconciliation and healing for Indigenous communities today.</p>
            <p>Efforts to address this issue require acknowledgment, understanding, and a commitment to justice. By learning about this history, we honor the survivors and those who were lost, while fostering the collective responsibility to ensure such injustices are never repeated.</p>
