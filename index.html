            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>The unmarked burial sites and undocumented deaths of Indigenous children at residential schools are a tragic legacy of historical injustices and systemic failures. These children were subjected to harsh conditions, abuse, and neglect, leading to countless deaths that were never properly recorded or acknowledged.</p>

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>To raise awareness, honor the lost children, and support Indigenous communities, we have created an educational campaign. This website and our video series aim to drive donations to aid these critical efforts.</p>
