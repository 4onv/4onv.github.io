            <h2>History, Context, Reconciliation</h2>
            <p>The history of residential schools in Canada stands as a profoundly painful and dark chapter, it shows the problematic systemic oppression towards the Indigenous communities. From the late 19th century well into the 20th century, thousands of Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families, stripped completely, of their cultural identities, and subjected to relentless humiliation. The residential schools were institutions where children experienced severe physical, emotional, and psychological abuse, leading to lifelong trauma. Tragically, many children never returned home, with numerous unmarked burial sites only now coming to light.</p>
            <p>This legacy is not merely a historical wrongdoing; it is a present-day reminder of the ongoing injustices and challenges faced by Indigenous peoples. The unearthing of these burial sites has triggered deep sorrow and has accentuated the continuous need for reconciliation and healing within these communities. The pain inflicted by these institutions reverberates through generations, manifesting in intergenerational trauma and loss of cultural heritage.</p>
            <p>It is not as easy as it seems, It requires a collective effort to educate, empathize, and take actionable steps towards reconciliation. By delving into and confronting this history, we pay homage to the resilience of survivors and those who were lost, while still creating a collective responsibility to ensure such atrocities never recur. This journey towards reconciliation is integral to the healing process and the restoration of dignity, identity, and heritage that were stripped away with our very own hands.</p>
