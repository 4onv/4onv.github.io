            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>The unmarked burial sites and undocumented deaths of Indigenous children at residential schools are a tragic legacy of historical injustices and systemic failures. These children were subjected to harsh conditions, abuse, and neglect, leading to countless deaths that were never properly recorded or acknowledged.</p>
